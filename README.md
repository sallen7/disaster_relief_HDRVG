After the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake, the Himalayan Disaster Relief Volunteer Group distributed supplies to affected areas.  We model the organizationâ€™s delivery of supplies as a vehicle routing problem using Fisher and Jaikumar's two-stage method, which allocates locations to vehicles via an integer program and then uses heuristics to route the vehicles.  In the allocation stage, we use the assignment problem formulation to assign locations to vehicles.  In the routing stage, we implement multiple heuristics for the sake of comparison.  Our results illustrate the open nature of the vehicle routing problem and the computational necessity of heuristics.
